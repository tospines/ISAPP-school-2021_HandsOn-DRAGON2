Basic instructions to install the DRAGON2 code.

Before installing DRAGON, you must be sure you have installed in your computer CFITSIO (follow instructions at https://guaix.fis.ucm.es/~ncl/howto/howto-cfitsio) and gsl (to download the las version, do wget https://mirror.ibcp.fr/pub/gnu/gsl/gsl-latest.tar.gz, then follow the instructions at https://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/jild13/2016/07/11/hello/)
Please, make sure you configured them before the tutorial!

From your terminal, go to the folder where you would like to have DRAGON2
  cd Tutorials
  
Download the contents for installing the software:
  git clone https://github.com/cosmicrays/DRAGON2-Beta_version.git
  
Go to the folder that has been created
  cd DRAGON2-Beta_version/

Initializing and configuring:
  ./start.sh
  ./configure --with-numcpu=2 --with-cfitsio=$CFITSIO_DIR --with-gsl-path=$GSL_bin_path
  make
  
 (for some users, you may need to include an option like CXX=g++ F77=gfortran in the ./configure step, in order to specify the compilers to be used)
